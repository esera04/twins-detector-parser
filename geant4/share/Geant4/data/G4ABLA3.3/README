The data files in this directory are based on ABLAXX:
    defo.dat - ground state deformations.
 flalpha.dat - alpha ground state deformation.
   frldm.dat - ground state shell corr. frldm for a spherical g.s.  
   vgsld.dat - difference between deformed g.s. and ldm value.
   pace2.dat - default mass for A, Z nucleus.
     rms.dat - Parameters for the calculation of particle emission barriers.
mass2003.dat - Binding energies from the experimental atomic mass evaluation AME2003.
mass2016.dat - Binding energies from the experimental atomic mass evaluation AME2016.
mass2020.dat - Binding energies from the experimental atomic mass evaluation AME2020.

The data in this directory is meant to be used for ABLA model
