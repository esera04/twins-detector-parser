elastic scattering (in JAEAESData/):

   All data available from: http://dx.doi.org/10.11484/jaea-data-code-2018-007

   These are new data set for the elastic scattering of gamma rays
   Data are used by the JAEAElasticScattering Model
   Cross section are for Rayleigh + nuclear Thomson + Delbrück scatterings  
    - Rayleigh amplitudes: Second order scattering matrix.
    - Nuclear Thomson amplitudes: Analytical.
    - Delbrück amplitudes: First order Born approximation.

   Integrated and differential cross section data files: cs_Z_NN.dat.
   NN = atomic number.
   Each file is 183 columns * 300 rows.
   Row 1 = Energy in keV.
   Row 2 = Integrated cross section in barn.
   Row 3 ~ 183 differential cross section at angles from 0 degree to 180 degree at the energy 
           of the corresponding first column in barn/sr.	

   Note: 
   1. Cross section data are limited to 3 MeV.
   2. The folder JAEAESDATA must be copied to 
      ~path-to-geant4-install/share/Geant4-10.X.0/data/G4EMLOW7.3
      Geant4 version and G4EMLOW data might be different from above 
      depending on the installed versions.
   3. This process is only valid for unpolarized gamma radiation.
