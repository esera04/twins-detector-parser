*** PIXE data files ***

All cross section data files needed for PIXE with protons and alphas are stored in the
ecpssr, uf, kpcsPaul, kacsPaul and exp directories located in the pixe directory.

* Data in the pixe/ecpssr subdirectory are derived from the work of :

- A. Taborda et al.,
"Polynomial approximation to universal ionisation cross-sections of K and L shells induced by H and He ion beams"
Published in X-Ray Spectrom. 2011, 40, 127-134

- A. Taborda et al.,
"Polynomial approximation to universal M-shell ionisation cross sections"
Published in X-Ray Spectrom. 2013, 42, 177-182
