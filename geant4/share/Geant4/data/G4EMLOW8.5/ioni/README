*** Electron process ***

ionisation (ioni):

   ion-ss-cs-NN.dat   = subshell cross sections

   ion-co-NN.dat      = delta ray energy spectrum formula coefficient (EEDL)  (+)
   io-co-NN.dat       = delta ray energy spectrum formula coefficient (EEDL)  (+)

coefficient for ionisation are obtained fitting delta ray spectrum with two functions

   * ion-co-NN.dat structure 

		column     type of data

		  1         incoming electron energy

                 2-7        first formula coefficients sum_i(A_i/(Energy+Binding)^i)

                  8         second formula coefficient  C_i/Energy^2

                  9         maximum of the rejection part of the first formula: 
                            sum_i(A_i/(Energy+Binding)^(i-1))

                10-11       subarea1 and subarea2 covered by the two formulas

		 12         separation cut 	    			

   * io-co-NN.dat structure (new fits with up to three functions)

		column     type of data

		  1         incoming electron energy

                 2-7        first formula coefficients sum_i(A_i/(Energy+Binding)^i) i=2,7

                  8         maximum of the rejection part of the first formula: 
                            sum_i(A_i/(Energy+Binding)^(i-1))

                 9-12       third formula coefficients sum_i(A_i/(Energy+Binding)^i) i=2,5

                 13         maximum of the rejection part of the first formula: 
                            sum_i(A_i/(Energy+Binding)^(i-1))

		14-15       second formula coefficient: C1*Energy^C2 

		 16         1st separation cut 	    			

		 17         2nd separation cut 	    			

each set of data in a file corresponding to subshells is separated by a line of -1.
The order of the functions 1st,2nd,3rd follows the increasing energy in which they are used
even if the second formula is the less used. (see Physics Reference Manual)
   
The cited Livermore data library is:

-- EEDL    Evaluated Electron Data Library 

(see http://www.llnl.gov/cullen1/)

-- The data have been reformatted for usage in Geant4 and the files(+) 
contain values resulting from fitting the original data.
